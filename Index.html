        <h2>General history</h2>
        <p>
          Basketball was invented in 1891 by Canadian Educator James
          Naismith.<br />
          He also made the rule book for basketball. The NBA was later
          created<br />
          in 1946 after the rising popularity of college basketball. Back in<br />
          1946 there was only 11 teams and in todays age there are now 30
          teams!<br />
